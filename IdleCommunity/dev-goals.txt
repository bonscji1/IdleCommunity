THIS IS A LIST OF GOALS FOR IDLE COMMUNITY
-i basically needed 1 place to place my ideas in so i don't lose them and i grew tired of looking for that one particular paper i wrote something on so here we go.

BASIC IDEA:
    welcome page: maybe greet people and explain the basics, introduce myself, show important stuff, should be easy to skip by menu bar places
    todo: later

VISUAL SIDE:
    Created how i want it to look visually, it is on the paper and its a drawing so shit i like it :D.
    i can live with 1 paper, may ad as picture later. it is basically blazor with custom containers, i fully expect this to improve and change is i go on.


CONTENT: this gonna be big so i need sections
    todo:later
